# Welcome to my Personal Website (rebuilt in Astro)

After seeing the release of [Astro 1.0](https://astro.build/), I was immediately tempted to rebuild my website (for the third time) to see what all of the hype was about. Although I was able to convince myself for a while that I had better things to do, when Heroku announced that they would be shutting down their free tier, I suddently had a limited lifespan on the tech stack for my current website (the backend was using a Postgres node). Although I could have fully just moved the backend to another provider such as [Railway](https://railway.app/), the combination of curiosity towards this new framework and also realizing that Next.js and a full backend were a bit overkill for my needs, meant that the course was charted and a route was set.

Unlike the last time I rebuilt my personal site, the design has not changed greatly this time - and instead I have focussed on polishing up a few details that had been bothering me from the last round of updates I had pushed to the site.
