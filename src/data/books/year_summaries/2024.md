year: 2024

I perpetually think I’m going to be more likely to read than I
actually am, and as much as I like to think that I will put in 10
minutes of the Hunchback of Notre Dame every night before bed, I
realised I’d rather read something ‘fun’ instead of trying to force
myself to read a ‘classic’ and ending up not reading anything at all.
I’m happy to say this worked pretty well, and did a lot more casual
reading this year than I have in years past.
