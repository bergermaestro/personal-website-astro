year: 2025

One of my goals for this year was to read more books, and I'm happy to say that I would consider this a goal well accomplished. Granted, being on co-op for 8 months gave me a lot more time, but it's something that I hope to keep up in the coming year. Amsusing Ourselves to Death is the book that I have spent the most time thinking about after reading, turns out that it's very easy to McLuhan-ify many aspects of our world. This coming year, I'm hoping to read a bit more fiction, including more of Adam Shoalts' books (thanks Ria), along with Project Hail Mary, hopefully before the movie comes out.
