Hi!

I'm Matthew, a first year mathematics student at the University of Waterloo, and this is my small corner of the internet. I’ve been passionate for computers and technology ever since I was young, and haven’t stopped learning since. Whether its web design, software development, or 3D modelling, I always manage to find something new to learn about.

Outside of the time I spend on the computer, I can never turn down a good hike, so don’t be surprised if you find some of my photos dotted around the site!

I'd be happy to hear any projects you might want to collaborate on, so feel free to drop me an e-mail or reach out to me on Twitter @itsmattberger.

Thanks for reading, and I hope to hear from you soon!

Matthew
