As a civilization, we have an unrelenting desire to move forward. We are always innovating, learning, and trying to improve our world. There have been innumerable advancements which have changed the course of human history, from our evolution as hunters and gatherers to inventions such as the compass, paper money, and electricity. Yet, I believe that there is a singular invention which supersedes all of this: the ability to communicate through a written language. The ability to write things down and have others understand them has given permanence to stories, evolution to ideas, and validity to rules, and can be seen as the impetus for many of the inventions mentioned above.

Yet, human history has not been without its flaws. Despite all these advancements, we have undeniably made errors and done things that we now deem barbaric and unacceptable. Slavery, human sacrifice, and many others. But, let me be honest. I think there is a greater evil, rampant in our society today, which overshadows all of these. I say it is this:

Using Times New Roman in 2022.

Now, I can’t be sure exactly how you’re feeling, but I can guess that you’re taken aback. Perhaps you’re feeling like you’ve just been told to end a relationship that you thought was healthy, or that issues such as homelessness and racism need to come before this insignificant quibble.

Well, let me explain why you’re wrong.

All of society today is based off the use of written documents. In courts you will see the Charter, in churches you will see the Bible, in universities you will see diplomas, in museums you will see manifestos, and in McDonalds you will see menus. Without this written language, our world would be unrecognizable.

So now that we have established the importance of written language, let us see why Times New Roman is incompatible with our society today.

Times New Roman was first designed in the 1930's by Stanley Morrison for London newspaper *the Times.* Even from this, we can see it’s design is inherently flawed. It's ascenders and ligatures bear the mark of the ideas that were popular in society at the time. The vertical stress on the capital ‘O’ reminds us of a ballot where not all women could vote and the pointy descender of the lowercase ‘q’ is a reminder of the harsh labour of federally sanctioned “unemployment relief camps.” This font was created when store owners could still refuse service to someone based on the colour of their skin. How are we supposed to share our new, enlightened ideas in a font that bears the hallmarks of all these injustices?

This is why we must cease to use it, and stop it from clouding our thinking, corrupting our thoughts, and ruining our morals.

And thankfully, I am not alone in this belief. Samuel Dawson, a fellow student had this to say when he was asked about his thoughts on Times New Roman:

*It's an abomination, cursing the beauty that I should be able to behold. Such wondrous word I could have beheld if not for their portrayal in such a horrific manner*

Of course, there were some people who disagreed. When asked, Daniel Stevens said this:

*"I personally like Times New Roman. It has an acute crisp style, one that I feel lends itself well to essays where you want accurate, diligent observations. In addition the capital N's are poignantly detailed, a wonderful way to head studies on Necromancy or Newman"*

And as a response to that, all I can say is - if you're interested in Necromancy or Newman, you might just want to move to the 1930s altogether.

I hope you can begin to agree with why we must eliminate this font from our repertoire, and rise above the subliminal messages that it contains within its lines. Yet, now you may be asking yourself, what can I use instead?

If you're writing something cool, hip, trendy or liberal - choose a sans serif. Those are the ones that don't have the pointy bits at the end. My recommendations are Helvetica, Lato, or Century Gothic. And if you’re mandated for a serif, Faustina or Merriweather are good recently created options.

Even if none of those options suit you, there’s lots of great fonts to choose from. But please, just don’t choose Comic Sans instead.
