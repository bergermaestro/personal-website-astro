> Update (03/14/22): This site is no longer hosted using WordPress, but instead using Next.js and Strapi (among other tools). I plan to write a post about why I decided to make the switch sometime soon, but thought I'd keep this article up because my thought process and the journey still holds. Thanks!

Hello Friends!

Thank you for checking out my website, I hope you enjoy what you find! Without further ado, I’ll let you get into my first blog post – the journey of creating this website.

Although the trope that web developer exist in a perpetual state of never finishing their personal website seems to have reached meme status, in my experience it seems to be grounded in some truth.

I say this because the journey to reach this final website took four different designs and about three different platforms – so certainly an adventure, and what could be more fun than going through all of them?


## Part 1: This Should be Easy

The beginning of the journey started all the way back in 2018, when I thought I should brush up on my HTML & CSS skills by building myself a personal website. I do have to admit this era was marked by an overly cavalier attitude towards the complexity of this project, where I was quite confident that having a  general colour scheme and layout in my head would be enough to code it from there. In retrospect, I’m not surprised I didn’t get very far past the header.

To regain confidence and inspiration, I watched a few Youtube videos from Charli Marie, a Barcelona based designer for the newsletter marketing company Convertkit.

It was here that I learned about Figma, a free design software similar to Sketch and Adobe XD, as Charli used it to show how she designs website layouts– so exactly what I needed to continue the journey. Since beginning to use it, I have become a big fan, using it for everything from the aforementioned web design, to brochures for school projects, to… the occasional meme.

So, after spending some time designing a new layout centered around using assorted shapes as accents throughout the website, a design that I still think looks pretty cool… albeit lacking a little bit of maturity I decided it was once again time to start coding.

## Part 2: Implementation option Overload 

Unfortunately, I think this is the moment when the “what platform do I use” bug bit.

After watching a few more of Charli’s videos, I was introduced to Webflow – a no-code website creator that combines a visual design experience while still allowing control over the same HTML and CSS properties that you would usually use while coding a website.

So, although I started in Webflow and enjoyed the experience, perhaps it was simply that school became more pressing, or because I ran out of motivation, but finishing this design slowly dropped further and further down my to-do list.

Yet as I am sure you have figured, this was not the end of the personal website saga. My decision that I needed a website was resurrected when I (and the rest of the world) had little else to do – the quarantine of 2020.

This time, I thought about creating a website under the name of a company – ‘Overpass Creative.’   Perhaps this was because I was trying to convince myself that no, I hadn’t actually abandoned my past personal websites, and that I would find a different use for them. Yet, once the main design was there, the last 10% required to add responsiveness and deploy it just never happened.

## Part 3: The Redemption

However, I wasn’t going to let this project best me. Knowing in the back of my mind that I had to create a website sooner or later, it was this final attempt that was the successful one. After looking at my previous designs and realizing that if I wanted to go through this process for the last time, I would need to build something which I would be happy with for a while to come, which meant realizing that for my personal taste, my past websites looked too much like they came from a template. Furthermore, I knew I wanted a site that was able to combine my skills in 3D modelling, photography and design.

Additionally, I also wanted to make sure I planned the project in a way that I would not get overwhelmed and would be able to build a foundation for the website and slowly polish it over time.

When it came to choosing a platform, I decided to create a WordPress site with a custom theme on a VPS (Virtual Private Server)

Although I looked at many alternatives, including Github Pages (which I still think is a great way to host a static page for free), I believe the experience gained by learning a platform with such ubiquity as WordPress is incredibly valuable, along with allowing its numerous features and plugins to assist my website creation journey.

Along the way I did look at other frameworks such as tailwindcss and bootstrap, though I figured that in order to make sure I actually finished the project, learning wordpress was enough.

Of course, there are still more things I plan to add, such as using threeJS to make the hamburger machine on the homepage interactive, but I have to say I’m happy to finally have a corner of the internet that I can call my own.
